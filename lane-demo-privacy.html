  <h1>Privacy Policy — Lane Demo</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: October 18, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Lane demo (“<strong>Demo</strong>”) processes information when you use our public Custom GPT with Actions to browse products and complete a test checkout using the Lane ACP Adapter API.</p>

  <h2>What data we process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chat content</strong> you type into ChatGPT (processed by OpenAI under its policies).</li>
    <li><strong>Product choices and quantities</strong> needed to create a checkout session.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact and shipping details</strong> you explicitly provide (e.g., name, email, address) to simulate fulfillment.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical logs</strong> such as timestamps, request identifiers, and non-sensitive API metadata for reliability and abuse prevention.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>We do not request or collect real payment card numbers.</em> The Demo uses test/dummy payment method tokens in sandbox environments. Please do not enter real PANs or sensitive credentials.</p>

  <h2>How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To call our demo APIs and show you product options and an order confirmation.</li>
    <li>To operate, troubleshoot, and secure the Demo (e.g., detect abuse, ensure idempotent retries).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We share data only with service providers that power the Demo (e.g., OpenAI to run the Custom GPT; hosting and monitoring vendors for the API). We do not sell personal information.</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>Demo API logs are retained for a limited period (e.g., 30–90 days) for reliability and abuse detection, then deleted or aggregated. Chat content may be retained by OpenAI per its policies.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard measures (HTTPS, access controls, token-based auth). This Demo is for evaluation only and is not meant for production processing of real customer data or payments.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not provide real payment details or unnecessary personal data.</li>
    <li>You may request deletion of Demo API logs that can reasonably be linked to you by contacting us (see below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The Demo is not directed to children under 13 (or the relevant age of digital consent in your jurisdiction).</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@lane.example">privacy@lane.example</a></p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted here with a new effective date.</p>

  <p class="muted">This Policy applies only to the Lane Demo. Your use of ChatGPT remains subject to OpenAI’s terms and privacy policy.</p>
